            <p>
              <br />
              It’s your first day of work after graduation.
            </p>

            <p>
              You walk through the office entrance and greet the receptionist,
              secretly relieved that you no longer have to endure
              <em>yet another visitor check-in on Envoy</em>. Someone cheerfully
              greets you, motioning to follow them to your desk, where everyone
              on your new team looks deeply engrossed in work. You reassure
              yourself that this is the opportunity you’ve been looking forward
              to.
            </p>

            <p>
              The next few days pass by in a blur, punctuated with onboarding
              talks whose dense content you’ll probably forget, and coffee chats
              with more co-workers than you can count from various teams at the
              company. You eventually settle into a routine, doing biweekly
              sprints with your team, building new features, engaging in
              one-on-ones with your team members, et cetera.
            </p>

            <p>
              Eventually, you begin to ask yourself:
              <strong>how do I actually succeed at this job?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              As a new grad engineer, what I would’ve loved when starting out is
              a concrete list of less obvious aspects of the job that I could’ve
              focused on to perform more effectively and grow faster. Think side
              quests in your favorite RPG that, when completed, give you
              experience, gold, and maybe, special items.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this post, I outline a few thoughts as advice I would’ve given
              my younger self. These are the most important lessons I’ve taken
              away in my first year working as an engineer at
              <a href="https://plaid.com">Plaid</a>, ones I wish the younger
              Evan knew and performed.
            </p>

            <h3 id="lesson-1-understand-the-end-to-end-service-architecture">
              Lesson #1: Understand the End-To-End Service Architecture
            </h3>
            <p>
              In your first few weeks, you’ll likely be tasked with building new
              functionality and fixing a handful of bugs. Most likely, this work
              will be constrained to only one or two services. Furthermore, you
              may be overwhelmed by the abundance of information that you need
              to pick up to properly start contributing to your team.
            </p>

            <p>
              I would argue that one of the most valuable pieces of learning you
              can acquire is a strong mental model of all the existing services.
              Learn what each one does at a very high level, and how they talk
              to one another in the overarching dependency graph. Understand the
              philosophy behind each service and the objectives they’re trying
              to achieve. Then, drill deeper into the implementation details as
              you encounter opportunities to work on a service. It helps to
              think about this like
              <a href="https://fs.blog/2015/01/elon-musk-knowledge/"
                >Elon Musk</a
              >
              does with knowledge.
            </p>

            <p>
              Doing this is much easier if you’re working at a small startup;
              the scale and complexity of services often correlate strongly with
              the size of the team. If you’re working in Big Tech, do this for
              your engineering group or division, and limit the scope to the
              immediate customer-facing product your code will affect.
            </p>

            <p>This is important for a number of reasons.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                It helps contextualize how your work will eventually affect end
                users.
              </li>
              <li>It improves your understanding of how the product works.</li>
              <li>
                It’s important for engaging in high-level architectural
                discussions.
              </li>
              <li>
                It will enable you to drive changes across multiple teams.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Conveniently, engineering teams are usually structured around
              service boundaries, so this could be a nice mnemonic to aid in
              learning about the various services. Granted, it may be difficult
              to internalize, but having a diagram of boxes and connecting
              arrows definitely helps. Get a senior engineer to draw one for you
              and stare at it before you go to sleep every night.
            </p>

            <p>
              Not doing this has been one of many regrets I’ve had over the past
              year. I should’ve done this immediately during the onboarding
              process, but I shook it off as unnecessary at the time. Realize
              that knowledge compounds over time, and having a strong mental
              model of the entire service stack is a crucial building block in
              better understanding how an engineering organization works.
            </p>

            <p>I apologize to my past self for the foregone growth.</p>

            <h3 id="lesson-2-learn-the-fundamentals-of-your-tech-stack">
              Lesson #2: Learn the Fundamentals of your Tech Stack
            </h3>
            <p>
              You can get by well just knowing how to code and conjuring magical
              data structures and algorithms from thin air, as was taught in
              college. In fact, this is mostly what companies test for in
              software interviews. However, building systems involves so much
              more than just writing code. Consider what it takes to get
              production-level code running.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here’s a quick list off the top of my head.
              <em
                >Logging, Secrets, Metrics, Containers, Servers, Databases, Load
                Balancers, Queues, Inter-Service Communication, Continuous
                Integration, Deployments</em
              >, and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
              Unfortunately, most of these are things you will never learn in
              college, at least if you went through the traditional US computer
              science curriculum. That’s fine. You’ll pick up the necessary
              skills quickly on the job, and learn to utilize these fancy,
              powerful tools in no time.
            </p>

            <p>
              Nonetheless, I would argue that it’s valuable to go beyond just
              “knowing how to use tool X from skimming examples” to
              “understanding the internals of tool X or language Y by reading
              online documentation, blog posts, and code”.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, there is a substantial difference between knowing how
              to use <a href="https://grpc.io">gRPC</a> — ”Oh, this lets us call
              typed functions in different services? Cool!” — and grokking that
              the underlying implementation utilizes HTTP/2 and maintains
              persistent connections between clients and servers. From
              experience, investing a bit of time into reading documentation and
              blog posts about the internals of gRPC has enabled me to make
              better architectural decisions and quickly debug failure modes in
              your system. Furthermore, since this is often something that few
              people do, you get to be an expert in a niche part of your
              company’s tech stack. People will eventually come to you bearing
              gifts in exchange for your sage advice.
            </p>

            <p>
              This generalizes to various technologies used by your engineering
              organization. Of course, there’s diminishing returns in investing
              too much time into learning; you still have a day job to tend to
              creating business value. A good litmus test I often use is seeing
              how well I’m able to explain the benefits and downsides of a
              technology to someone else. You should aspire to be able to walk
              up to a random engineer and start a 5 minute long conversation
              about it.
            </p>

            <p>Now go read up on the logging infrastructure at your company.</p>

            <h3 id="lesson-3-move-fast-and-improve-things">
              Lesson #3: Move Fast and Improve Things
            </h3>
            <p>
              You may have heard the now Silicon-Valley-famous quote, “<a
                href="https://xkcd.com/1428/"
                >Move Fast and Break Things</a
              >”. Long story short, you do not want to be embodying this ethos,
              despite all that pent-up post-graduation excitement of wanting to
              write code and ship a ton of features. Though “Break Things” was
              probably meant as a hyperbole — unless Zuck actually wanted
              Facebook engineers to break things — it does instill the mindset
              that it’s fine to ship breaking changes, as long as you’re moving
              quickly.
            </p>

            <p>
              I prefer the phrase “Move Fast and Improve Things”. The subtext
              here is that systems are already functional in the first place
              i.e. nothing is broken, for you to be able to improve them. I
              would argue that Moving Fast and Doing Things Correctly are things
              already expected of us as engineers who have passed the 6 feet
              high interview bar.
            </p>

            <p>
              Making things better, on the other hand, is much more of an
              acquired skill. <em>First</em>, you have to notice that something
              is missing; in my experience, this comes only with, you guessed
              it, experience. Forgive the
              <a href="http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Figures/D/diacope.htm">diacope</a
              >. <em>Second</em>, you need to take the initiative to either
              communicate this gap to other engineers, or allocate resources
              (time, mental energy) to fix the problem yourself. <em>Third</em>,
              and finally, this change needs to be announced to people who care
              about them. Because hey,
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest"
                >if a tree falls in a forest</a
              >… you get the point. It’s a nontrivial amount of effort to
              improve things, especially if they’re not related to your sprint
              goals. However, everyone else will thank you for making their
              lives easier.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’ve done this enough over the past year that I have a mental list
              of low hanging, high ROI improvements dangling from my brain tree.
              Here it is, for your perusal:

              One hack I’ve come up with to help me manage such a list is to
              maintain a backlog of tasks (use a priority queue) that you can
              pick off from whenever you’re blocked on your main sprint work. I
              would place quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes that are
              non-urgent here. Of course, project work would preempt working on
              these so-called “improvements”.

              In a similar vein, the blog post titled
              <a
                href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things-smart.html"
                >Done and Gets Things Smart</a
              >
              is an excessively verbose rant that makes for good bedtime
              reading.

            <h3 id="lesson-4-understand-that-processes-are-a-necessary-evil">
              Lesson #4: Understand that Processes are a Necessary Evil
            </h3>
            <p>
              We’re not talking about the Operating System concept of a process
              here. As quoted from the dictionary, a process is “a series of
              actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end.” As
              abstract as the concept is, I did not fully internalize it until I
              started working full-time.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’m not a huge fan of processes, and held a stronger disdain for
              them when I first started on the job. They reek of bureaucracy —
              or whatever it is people in suits do all day — and are
              antithetical to engineering values like moving fast and iterating
              quickly. In fact, to my delight, I’m convinced that everyone I
              work with share a similar contempt for processes.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, I’ve come to realize that processes are very important
              for ensuring long term business value. Not only do they ensure
              that a commonly done set of tasks can be committed to and improved
              upon, they also minimize variance in doing those tasks in large
              teams. Processes ensure execution consistency and are necessary
              because unlike software, humans are moving parts that often make
              mistakes.
            </p>

            <p>
              It’s true that they introduce friction and complexity into getting
              more concrete things done, but I’ve come to realize that processes
              are
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_complexity"
                >essential complexity</a
              >. In fact, processes are what hold the fabric of an organization
              together as it grows. If every engineer in a team of 50 were to
              use guerilla tactics to ship features however every one of them
              preferred, imagine the chaos that would ensue.
            </p>

            <p>
              Processes can take many forms, and include the following things.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Writing a Technical Spec for huge projects.</li>
              <li>Documenting unknown parts of the system.</li>
              <li>Doing a Postmortem for all production issues.</li>
              <li>
                Sending out a message to communicate any important change to a
                system.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The astute reader may notice a common thread among all of these:
              they involve communicating information about something to other
              people on the team. There is one silver lining here though, which
              is that overcommunication is never bad. Not communicating things
              is almost always worse than communicating, unless you’re working
              on secret projects with classified information.
            </p>

            <h3 id="lesson-5-write-more-code-documentation">
              Lesson #5: Write more <del>Code</del> Documentation
            </h3>
            <p>
              Concretely, your job as an engineer is to solve business problems
              and deliver value to the company. The implementation of this
              mostly involves writing code and shipping features, but there are
              often more important tasks. One of these, as was hinted at
              earlier, is writing documentation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Documentation may take various forms: code comments, commit
              messages, emails, google docs, wiki entries, README files, and so
              on. The format depends on the context in which the information
              will be used. For instance, emails serve as a wide-reaching,
              permanent, and searchable documentation format that should be used
              for non-urgent content such as important announcements or engaging
              in longer-term async conversations.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here are two less obvious, yet crucial purposes, that are served
              by docs.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                They reduce the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor"
                  >bus factor</a
                >
                on your team.
              </li>
              <li>
                They act as a permanent archive for temporal context that will
                inevitably fade.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p style="color:red">
              The more documentation you write, the better and faster you get at
              it. Inevitably, technical writing is a valuable skill to have
              throughout your entire career, and there is no better time to
              start than now. It’s one of the most scalable methods for
              information diffusal (as compared to more transient methods such
              as speech and instant messaging), and becomes more consequential
              as the organization grows. Now, do you want to
              <em>Improve Things</em>? Go write some docs and send it out to
              your team.

            <p>
              Having touched a lot of systems and worked on a myriad of
              different things over the past year at Plaid, these 5 points have
              been my most important takeaways. These are personal lessons that
              may not apply to everyone, so take these with a grain of salt. I
              still hope you find them useful for your burgeoning career.
